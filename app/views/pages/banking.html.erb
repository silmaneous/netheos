<p>Develop a secure mobile application quickly and easily to fight against online fraud, as well as to reduce your costs and increase revenue by developing new digital banking services.</p>

<p>Unlike inflexible software solutions that force you to follow their own user experience, the eKeynox Mobile Security Framework enables you to fully update your application, whether web-based or native. You benefit from modules that are easy to integrate, making security and electronic signature management transparent for users. This solution provides security in both technical and legal terms, notably for transactions and contracts.</p>

<p>With eKeynox you can build a long-lasting trusted relationship with your customers by giving them new ways to use their smartphones.</p>

<h1>Transaction validation<span class="h1-baseline">Use case</span></h1>

<p> Today, SMS OTP (one-time password) offer a first level of security by providing a validation code, above all communicating transaction data via an out-of-band channel (in case the first channel has been compromised). Whereas this does not guarantee that you can submit the order, it does confirm some level of legitimacy. On the other hand, SMS OTP poses problems related to cost, security and use, so banks are now looking towards alternative smartphone-based software solutions (out-of-band validation).</p>

<p>eKeynox lets you create a list of transactions that have been validated or for which validation is pending (payments, debits, transfers, new beneficiaries, etc.). New transactions are &quot;pushed&quot; in order to notify the user that he/she needs to enter a PIN code for validation. If several transactions still need to be validated, it is also possible to enter the PIN code just one time for batch validation.</p>

<p>Whether the application is web-based or local, eKeynox provides strong authentication of clients using their smartphones, ensuring privacy for all the data stored on the device, as well as the privacy and integrity of all transactions exchanged between the smartphones and your server infrastructure via a mutually authenticated SSL connection. In addition, this solution enables you to permanently associate your client with the transaction that was validated by an electronic signature. This makes it possible to store lasting non-repudiable proof of the validation.</p>


<h1>Cash management<span class="h1-baseline">Use case</span></h1>

<%= image_tag("../images/ekeynox_hardwares.png", :alt => "eKeynox security hardwares", :class => "picto-r") %>

<p>Cash management applications enable corporate bank clients to manage, track and optimize their cash and banking operations, such as transfers, debits, payments, and more. These applications are particularly sensitive because of the critical nature of the exchanged information and orders.</p>

<p>eKeynox gives these applications a high level of security from smartphones. Whether the application is web-based or local, eKeynox provides strong authentication of clients using their smartphones, ensuring privacy for all the data stored on the device, as well as the privacy and integrity of all transactions exchanged between the smartphones and your server infrastructure via a mutually authenticated SSL connection. In addition, this solution enables you to permanently associate your client with the transaction that was validated by an electronic signature. This makes it possible to store lasting non-repudiable proof of the validation.</p>

<p>In order to provide maximum security, security hardware is available for each platform. Your client's identity and encrypted electronic signature key are stored on it.</p>
